# `Elm`(_ish_) ?

`Elm`(_ish_) is our **`Elm`**-_inspired_ `JavaScript` (**ES5**)
front-end _micro_-framework.[<sup>1</sup>](#notes)

## _Why?_

The purpose of building `Elm`(_ish_) is _not_ to "_replace_" Elm
or to create _yet another_ front-end JS framework!

The purpose of _separating_ the `Elm`(_ish_) functions
into a "micro framework" is: <br />
**a)** to ***simplify*** the Todo List application code. <br />
**b)** _demonstrate_ a ***re-useable*** (_fully-tested_)
"**micro-framework**" that allows us to _practice_ the Elm Architecture.<br />
**c)** get into the **mindset** of writing **tests _first_**
and **`then`** the _least_ amount of code necessary to pass the test
(_while meeting the acceptance criteria_).

By the end of this exercise you will _understand_
The Elm Architecture (TEA) _much better_
because we will be analysing, documenting, testing
and writing each function required
to build the fully functional "micro framework" ***from scratch***.




## _What?_



You are already _familiar_ with the first few functions
`mount` and `empty`

## Notes

<sup>1</sup><small>The reason for calling the micro-framework `Elm`(_ish_)
is to **emphasize** that it is "**inspired by**" **`Elm`**.
The only things `Elm`(_ish_) shares with `Elm`
are the "MUV" architecture "pattern"
and function naming/argument similarity.
In all other respects `Elm`(_ish_) is a "**poor imitation**"
and should _only_ be used for learning purposes!
To _truly_ appreciate the awesome elegance, simplicity, power
and personal effectiveness of using Elm, there is **no substitute**
for the "real thing".
