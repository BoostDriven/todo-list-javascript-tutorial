# Elm(_ish_) ?

Elm(_ish_) is our **`Elm`** "_inspired_" `JavaScript` (**ES5**)
front-end _micro_-framework.<sup>1</sup>

## _Why?_

The purpose of building Elm(_ish_) is _not_ to "_replace_" Elm
or to create _yet another_ front-end JS framework!

The purpose of _separating_ the Elm(ish) functions into a "micro framework" is:
**a)** to ***simplify*** the Todo List application code. <br />
**b)** _demonstrate_ a ***re-useable*** (_fully-tested_)
"**micro-framework**" that allows us to _practice_ the Elm Architecture.<br />
**c)** get into the **mindset** of writing **tests _first_**
and then the _least_ amount of code necessary to pass the test
(_while meeting the acceptance criteria_).


By the end of this exercise you will _understand_
The Elm Architecture (TEA) _much better_ because we will be
analysing, documenting, testing and writing each function required
to build the fully functional "micro framework".


<sup>1</sup><small>The reason for calling the micro-framework Elm(ish)
is to emphasize that it is "**inspired by**" **`Elm`**.
But the only thing Elm(ish) shares with Elm is the architecture "pattern".
In all other respects Elm(ish) is a "poor imitation" and should _only_
be used for learning purposes!
To _truly_ appreciate the awesome elegance, simplicity, power
and personal effectiveness of using Elm, there is **no substitute**
for the "real thing".

You are already _familiar_ with the first few functions
`mount` and `empty`
